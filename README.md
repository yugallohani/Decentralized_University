# Decentralized Autonomous University (DAU)

An open, decentralized platform on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for education, where courses are created and taught by the community, leveraging AI for personalized learning paths and blockchain for certifications.

## 🌟 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Decentralized Course Creation**: Community-driven course development with instructor verification
- **AI-Powered Learning Paths**: Personalized course recommendations based on user skills and goals
- **Blockchain Certifications**: Tamper-proof, verifiable certificates stored on-chain
- **DAO Governance**: Community-controlled platform governance through proposals and voting
- **Reputation System**: Merit-based recognition for contributors and learners

### Platform Components
- **User Management**: Registration, profiles, roles, and reputation tracking
- **Course Management**: Course creation, content delivery, progress tracking, and reviews
- **Certification System**: Automated certificate issuance with cryptographic verification
- **Governance System**: Proposal creation, community voting, and automated execution

## 🏗 Architecture

The platform is built as a collection of interconnected canisters on the Internet Computer:

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
